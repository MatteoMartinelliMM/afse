# Marvel Sticker Collection Project

## Overview

This project is a web application developed for a university exam. It focuses on creating a collection of Marvel stickers, allowing users to manage and interact with their collections seamlessly.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: The application is built using Vanilla JavaScript. To enhance the user experience, I have developed a mini framework that enables the web app to function as a Single Page Application (SPA).
- **Backend**: The server-side is implemented using Express.js, ensuring a robust and scalable API. It employs JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and uses MongoDB for data storage. The routes are organized and separated to maintain a clean and manageable code structure.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure login and registration system using JWT.
- **Sticker Management**: Users can add, edit, and delete stickers from their collection.
- **Single Page Application**: Smooth navigation and dynamic content loading without full page reloads.
